* OO helps to design in a more natural way. Things hava way of eveolving 
* Not messing around with the codes already tested just to add new features
* I like that the data and the methods that operate on that data are together in one class 
* Reusing codes in other application. When I write a new class I can make it flexible enough to be used in something new later 

THINKOMNG ABPOIUT OBJECTS
**************************
- When you design a class, think about the objects that will be created from that class type.
 Think about:
􏰈 - things the object knows
􏰈 - things the object does
* Things an object knows about itself are called: instance variables
  They represent an object state and can have a unique values for each object of that type.
